# Detecting Fake and Genuine Reviews from Amazon

## Objective
The project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to classify Amazon product reviews as either fake or genuine. With the growing prevalence of fake reviews, this project seeks to enhance consumer trust and decision-making by accurately identifying deceptive feedback.

## Background
Fake reviews can significantly impact consumer behavior and sales. Amazon, as one of the largest e-commerce platforms, faces challenges with fraudulent reviews that mislead buyers and undermine the credibility of genuine feedback. Addressing this issue is crucial for maintaining trust and ensuring the integrity of online reviews.

## Impact
By implementing this model, Amazon and other e-commerce platforms can better detect and filter out fake reviews, leading to improved consumer trust and satisfaction. This project contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance review authenticity and support informed purchasing decisions.
